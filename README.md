This was my final project for my QTM 340 course on natural language processing at Emory University, taught by Prof. Lauren Klein. I also worked with peers Ari Gurovich and Joshua Kim on this.

Country is a distinct and popular musical genre, particularly common in rural and southern areas of the United States. Its songs blend melancholic and uplifting melodies with simple lyrics exploring sadness, resilience, and faith within classic American imagery and through relatable blue-collar experiences. While it’s not difficult to identify country music by ear, objectively describing what makes a song ‘country’ is less easy. This project aims to uncover the defining linguistic and thematic characteristics of the genre: what makes country lyrics distinctly “country”, distinguishing them from those of other genres? We do so by employing several natural language processing methods that we have learned over the course of our QTM 340 class to a large dataset containing lyrics from country and non country songs. These methods include topic modeling, log odds analysis, vocabulary richness metrics, and sentiment analysis. From these findings we reveal insights into the emotional tones, thematic patterns, and lexical sophistication of country music. These findings contribute to the growing field of computational musicology, provide a template for the analysis of other genres, and a foundation for the generation of country song lyrics down the line.
